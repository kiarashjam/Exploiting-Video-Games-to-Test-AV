# Add Obstacles

This operator is about adding some obstacles to the simulated scenario,e.g., pedestrians or signs. These obstacles may interfere with the lane-keeping feature.

# the step which active now
step two


# step one:

this part task is implmeenting the three tasks belows:

function 1: generate road

function 2: add obstacle

function 3: change position of obstacle


# step two :

this part task is implmeenting the four tasks belows:

function 1: add the tig level and implement the scenario on tig / use the road and object inside tig

function 2: define  add obstacle function  add_obstacle(road, obstacle_coordinates) and its random coordintes 

function 3: define the move obstacle function  new_obstacle_coordinates = move(old_obstacle_coordinates) And then road_with_obstacle = move_obstacle(old road_with_obstacle, new_obstacle_coordinates)

function 4 : define the ai_script for vehicle to go in the lane on the road 




# how to run the test


with the command below you can run the whole program 

```python AddObstacle.py```

# outcome

the outcome will save in three png files in the outcome folder with the folder which the name is " testing + the time yo test it "
