# Change illumination

This operator will test the car at a different time of the day.  I will try to modify the brightness of the whole scenario.


# Running test 

it will run with the command below:

```py change_illumination.py```

Furthermore, the program will execute beamng twice:

1- first one, the program chooses the number between 0 and 1. the 24 hours is divided into 0 and 1, which means 0.5 is 12 am and 0 and 1 is midnight. This class also adds one extra feature, which is turning on the light. If the program's random number shows the illumination of the scenario is between 0.2 and 0.65, it means the scenario is the night time of the day, which has no good light. So the program turns on the headlight.

2- in the second time, which is the modified version of the first scenario, the program chooses the number between zero and the brightness of the main scenario and another one between the brightness of the main scenario and one and pass these two number two the function, the function also chooses randomly between the two number and set the new brightness for the program.


# Requirments

At first, install the requirements and dependencies with the command. : 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# outcome 

The outcome will save in the outcome's folder. The outcome will be in a txt file with the main brightness and amount of the changing and modified brightness.
