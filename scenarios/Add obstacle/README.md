# Add Obstacles

This operator is about adding some obstacles to the simulated scenario,e.g., pedestrians or signs. These obstacles may interfere with the lane-keeping feature.


# Running test 

This part of the project used the tool which was provided in the one competition. The is the link to the repository: : https://github.com/se2p/tool-competition-av


# Requirments

At first, install the requirements and dependencies with the command. : 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# BeamNG Simulator Installation

0. Install a Subversion (SVN) client, e.g. TortoiseSVN.
1. Go to the directory where you want to checkout the BeamNG.research repository.
2. SVN Checkout the version 1.6.1.0 of the simulator (the one we used for the experiments);
3. Provide the URL of the repository that is either:
3.1 The URL of the standard version is https://projects.beamng.com/svn/research. 
**Note:** we have tested our tool with the unlimited version instead. 
3.2 The URL of the unlimited version (that we used for our experiments) is https://projects.beamng.com/svn/beamng-research_unlimited/ 
**Note:** you will be prompted to add your username and password to checkout the unlimited version. These may be obtained by sending a mail to research@beamng.gmbh and providing your motivation.
4. Add an environment variable named BNG_HOME pointing to the folder **trunk** (the full path), which is inside the repository you checked out. 
5. Edit the Path environment variable by adding %BNG_HOME%.

The less powerful graphics card we have successfully tested our tool with is an NVIDIA GeForce 940MX.

# Naive Random Generator
This test generator (`random_generator.py`) generates roads by sampling four points in the map between `0` and `map_size` randomly.

This test generators heavily rely on interpolation to generate the roads, it is fast, but also generates many invalid roads.


To invoke this generator please run the following code from the root of the project (activate your `venv` before):

```
python competition.py --time-budget 10 --executor beamng --map-size 200 --module-name sample_test_generators.random_generator --class-name RandomTestGenerator
```

You can see the result in the Simulation BeamNG simulation.
