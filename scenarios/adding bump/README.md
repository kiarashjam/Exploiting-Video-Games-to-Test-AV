# Changing weather condition

This operator is about adding rain and fog to the simulator. This bump may interfere with the lane-keeping feature.


# Requirments

At first, install the requirements and dependencies with the command. : 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```



# step one:

this method has two functions which are fog and rain. If the user chooses rain, it will delete the last version of the 'tig' folder in your computer's levels folder (in which all the scenarios are defined). Then it installs the new version of the scenario with the modification of the raindrops.
Also, for the fog, it works in the same way.

After changing the level folder, the program starts with rain or fog, depending on what the user chooses.




# step two :

In the modification function :

it starts from changing the amount of rain or fog. 

Moreover, it will apply to the whole program with the new scenario.






# how to run the test


With the command below, you can run the whole program.

```python adding_bump.py```

# outcome

The outcome will save in three png files in the outcome folder with the folder which the name is " testing + the time yo test it." 


the parameters will be for the rain :

the main number of the rain, the amount of change, the modification number of rain.

also, for the fog :
The fog's primary density, the amount of modification, and the modified version of the fog density.
